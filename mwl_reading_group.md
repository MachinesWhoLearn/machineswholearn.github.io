title: MWL Reading Group
---

We're reading research papers about various topics in machine learning and
artificial intelligence. Meetings will be informal, reading-group style with one
or two people assigned to lead a discussion about the readings.

**We're meeting on Thursdays at 5:00 PM during Spring Quarter.**
