Machines Who Learn is a student-led, for-students interest group for all things
machine learning, artificial intelligence, or data science related. Our goal is
to support a tight-knit community of students interested in data by providing
them with a space to come together.

If you're interested in joining us, feel free to come to any of our events
above and join our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/machines-who-learn/join) or
[Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/MachinesWhoLearn) to stay up to
date with what we're up to.

We're on GitHub at [github.com/MachinesWhoLearn](https://github.com/MachinesWhoLearn).
